# Processing Assignment 4: Mad Libs

In this assignment you will create a mad lib. If you are not familiar with this silly children's game, take a look at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs before reading further.



Find a poem of your choice that has at least ten lines and save it as a plain text file in the ```MadLibs/data``` directory. Name the file ```poem.txt```. You can use any poem you choose to but if you cannot think of any you can start here  http://hellopoetry.com/shel-silverstein/poems/title/ for some poems by Shel Silverstein.

You will be using this poem to create a mad lib by replacing the nouns, verbs and adjectives in the poem by random words from the ```nouns.txt```, ```verbs.txt``` and ```adjectives.txt``` files.

Open ```poem.txt``` in a text editor and replace nouns with the tag ```<noun>```, verbs with ```<verb>``` and adjectives with ```<adjective>```. You do not have to replace all the nouns, verbs and adjectives with tags. It is up to you to decide with ones to replace to get a "good " mad lib. Avoid using the same tage more than once per row (try to figure out why a tag appearing more than once in a row would be a problem).
